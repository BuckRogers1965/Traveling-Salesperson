# Traveling-Salesperson
A repository for work on traveling salesperson problem.

A fast, greedy local minimum path finder for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) that consistently outperforms the standard nearest neighbor algorithm in both speed and solution quality.

## Algorithm Overview

This implementation uses a **global greedy, local minima** approach that mimics crystal growth patterns:

1. **Global Edge Selection**: Always selects the shortest remaining edge from all available edges
2. **Path Fragment Management**: Maintains multiple growing path fragments (like crystal nucleation sites)
3. **Organic Merging**: Connects path endpoints to form larger fragments until a single tour emerges
4. **Natural Structure**: Allows the underlying city geometry to dictate the tour structure

## Key Advantages

- **Better Solution Quality**: Typically finds tours ~4-10% shorter than nearest neighbor
- **Fewer Crossings**: Generates roughly half the crossing edges compared to nearest neighbor
- **Comparable Speed**: Similar computational complexity with better constant factors
- **Visual Appeal**: Creates organic, crystal-like growth patterns when visualized

## How It Works

Unlike nearest neighbor's sequential approach, this algorithm:

1. Sorts all edges by distance once at the beginning
2. Greedily selects the shortest edge that doesn't violate path constraints:
   - No vertex can have degree > 2
   - No cycles until the final connection
3. Maintains multiple growing path fragments simultaneously
4. Continues until all cities are connected in a single tour

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Crystal Growth | Nearest Neighbor |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Solution Quality | Better | Baseline |
| Crossing Edges | ~40% fewer | Baseline |
| Speed | Comparable | Baseline |
| Visual Pattern | Organic growth | Chaotic exploration |

## Visualization

The algorithm creates a fascinating visual pattern:
- **Crystal Growth**: Multiple clusters form and grow organically
- **Natural Boundaries**: Clusters expand until they meet natural distance barriers
- **Intelligent Merging**: Final connections made at optimal junction points

Compare this to nearest neighbor's "single thread exploring a maze" approach.

## Algorithm Details

### Edge Selection Strategy
- Pre-sort all edges by distance: O(nÂ² log n)
- Select shortest valid edge: O(1) per selection
- remove cities internal to a path from list 
- Path constraint checking: O(1) per edge

### Path Fragment Management
- Each city starts as a single-node path
- Paths grow by connecting endpoints only
- Maintains path integrity until final tour completion

### Post-Processing
- Optional non-crossing edge optimization
- Applied equally to compare with other algorithms
- Typically requires fewer fixes than nearest neighbor

## Test Results

Tested on various TSP instances:
- Random geometric distributions
- Clustered city layouts  
- Standard TSP benchmarks
- Scales effectively to 500+ cities
